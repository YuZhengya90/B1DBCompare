be : C:\Program Files (x86)\SAP\hdbclient\hdbsql.exe. And DBCompare is in the local 
directory.
If it works correctly, it always generated some types of files for you to debug:
.\working\<datetime of you click compare>\L_Key_Table.SQL -> Left  Key SQL
.\working\<datetime of you click compare>\R_Key_Table.SQL -> Right Key SQL
.\working\<datetime of you click compare>\L_Key_Table.RST -> Left  SQL Result
.\working\<datetime of you click compare>\R_Key_Table.RST -> Right SQL Result
.\working\<datetime of you click compare>\O_Table_LKey_RKey.TXT -> End Result

If none result of the Business Objects sub tables or all the table columns are 
the same, it will not display on the result list.
